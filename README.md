> example to use AWS CDK to define an S3 bucket hosting a static website

This is an example demonstrating the usage of AWS CDK to define an S3 bucket and its necessary permissions to host a static website.

## Pre-requisites

- Create an AWS account. If you're new to AWS services and want to explore, I highly recommend setting up a billing alarm so that you don't incur any charges.
- Install NodeJS and npm -  https://nodejs.org/en/ - npm is installed automatically with NodeJS
- Install the AWS command line interface
- Configure AWS client: aws configure; you will be asked for access key ID, secret access key and aws region (details can be found here)
- Install the AWS CDK globally: npm install -g aws-cdk

## Installation

```sh
cd infrastructure & npm install
